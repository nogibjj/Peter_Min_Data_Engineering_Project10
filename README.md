This is the README for my Mini Project 10 for the IDS706 - Data Engineering Systems class at Duke University.

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to load data from locally or from a URL (my choice) using PySpark on Databricks community edition to conduct data analytics tasks harnessing the cloud's computing power. I ran all the scripts on Databricks in a Jupyter Notebook and downloaded it to my local system for code formatting. Here is also a link to my [Databricks-hosted notebook](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/2921567271133324/2429092692675170/3082746321351043/latest.html).
